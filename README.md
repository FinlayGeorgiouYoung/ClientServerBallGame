# ClientServerBallGame
A client server project, which is a simple pass the ball game, with a text based UI. The main focus of this project was multi-threaded programming.

### How to run
- Run the Server project first, and wait for it to say "Waiting for incoming connections...".
- Once a server is up and running, Clients can begin to join. To add a client/player to the game, run the Client project.
- Once the client has been assigned a player ID, you can then begin to play.
- To play you have to pass the ball to other players by typing "pass {playerID}", where {playerID} is the corresponding player ID of the player you want to pass to.
